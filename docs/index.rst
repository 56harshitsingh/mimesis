Python that can produce a wide range of fake data in multiple languages. This tool is useful
for populating testing databases, creating fake API endpoints, generating custom structures
in JSON and XML files, and anonymizing production data, among other things. With Mimesis,
developers can obtain realistic, randomized data easily to facilitate development and testing.
